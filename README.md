Emotions are essential, not only in personal life but in business as well. How your customers and target audience feel about your products or brand provides you with the context necessary to evaluate and improve the product, business, marketing, and communications strategy. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining helps researchers and companies extract insights from user-generated social media and web content.
